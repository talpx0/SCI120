### GDP evolution and two recessions

Quarterly real GDP data show steady expansions through most of 2005–2007, with declines concentrated in the Great Recession (2007–2009) and the brief pandemic recession in 2020. Using BEA/FRED’s “Real GDP: Percent Change from Preceding Quarter,” GDP fell in **five** quarters during the 2008–2009 episode: **2008Q1, 2008Q3, 2008Q4, 2009Q1, and 2009Q2**. In 2020, GDP fell in **two** quarters: **2020Q1 and 2020Q2**. ([FRED][1])

How fast did GDP grow *after* each recession ended? After the June 2009 trough, growth resumed but was moderate by historical early-cycle standards (e.g., 2009Q3–2010 saw several quarters in the 2–4% annualized range). By contrast, after the April 2020 trough, reopening plus unprecedented policy support produced a record **+33.4% (annualized)** jump in **2020Q3**, followed by additional gains—an exceptionally rapid rebound relative to typical postwar recoveries. ([FRED][1])

Labor markets echo these patterns. The unemployment rate peaked at **10.0% (Oct 2009)** around the Great Recession, and at **14.7% (Apr 2020)** during the pandemic shock. ([Bureau of Labor Statistics][2])

### NBER business cycles since 1946; average durations; the 2020 endpoint

According to the NBER’s official chronology, the post-WWII record lists **12** peak-to-trough cycles from the late-1940s through the business-cycle peak of **February 2020**; no subsequent peak was dated through 2023, so the count remains 12 for 1946–2023. Postwar averages on the NBER page (1945–2020) show recessions (contractions) lasting **~10 months** on average and expansions (trough-to-peak) lasting **~64 months**. The expansion that began in **June 2009** and ended at the **February 2020** peak lasted **128 months—the longest on record** and roughly double the postwar average.

For the 2020 episode specifically, the NBER dated the **trough in April 2020**, making it the **shortest U.S. recession on record (two months)**. ([NBER][3])

### Credit crunch, and did one occur in 2020?

A **credit crunch** is a sudden tightening of lending—credit supply shrinks even for good borrowers—usually triggered by losses, risk aversion, or capital/liquidity strains in the financial system. It’s commonly associated with recessions because banks face losses and raise standards, and investors flee to safer assets, raising the cost of credit. ([FRED][4])

Evidence from the **Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey** shows a sharp 2020 spike in the **net percent of banks tightening standards on commercial & industrial (C&I) loans**, consistent with credit-crunch dynamics. However, aggressive policy steps blunted the severity. In **March–June 2020**, the Federal Reserve launched emergency facilities—including the **Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities (PMCCF/SMCCF)**—to backstop corporate bond markets (including eligible ETFs) and restore market functioning, alongside other liquidity facilities. These actions materially eased conditions for larger firms and financial markets. ([Quizlet][5]) the Fed’s facilities and fiscal support helped **prevent a prolonged, system-wide credit crunch**, particularly in investment-grade corporate credit. ([Federal Reserve][6])

### Direct vs. indirect finance, asymmetric information.

**Direct finance** occurs when borrowers obtain funds **directly** from savers by issuing securities. **Indirect finance** routes funds through **finanmutual funds, etc.), whichcial intermediaries** (banks,  screen, monitor, and transform risk/maturity for savers and borrowers. Because intermediaries specialize in **reducing asymmetric information** (adverse selection ex ante, moral hazard ex post), **asymmetric information problems are central in indirect finance** and are precisely why intermediaries exist and matter. ([Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis][7])

The **principal–agent** problem arises when managers or traders (agents) at **systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs)** take risks that shareholders, creditors, taxpayers don’t fully observe or wouldn’t prefer. With expectations of support in a crisis (the “**too-big-to-fail**” problem), creditors under-price risk and managers may take **excessive leverage or tail risk**—classic **moral hazard**—raising the chance of failure with systemic spillovers. Post-crisis speeches and research from the Federal Reserve emphasize higher capital/liquidity and resolution regimes to curb these incentives. ([Federal Reserve][8])
